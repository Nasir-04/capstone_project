8,Great stay - we'll be back,"We had a wonderful stay at Ziway. We arrived at 8.30am and we were allowed to check in to our room early, without question. Breakfast was great - fresh eggs / omelette made to order, great coffee. T The resort is full of birds - fish eagles and little yellow and blue birds and we loved how lush and well kept the property gardens were.
the pool was clean and well presented but there were only 4 lounge chairs - wooden, no mattresses and slightly broken. This is an area that could be addressed. We were given pool towels which was great.

The bungalows are small and the fan in our room sounded like an airplane taking off so we couldn't use it. It would be great if there was a mosquito mesh on the window so we could sleep with the window open."
8,The orders are so great they are well trained of the customer service. I like to appreciate,"The breakfast was great and the location is easily locatable.
Some of the facilties like sauna steam are very poor, the TV shall include ds tv"
6,Pleasant,"That we were not satisfied with our room and they helped us in changing rooms
Need to have a small refrigerator and a small lamp in each bedroom"
6,Pleasant,"The junior suite should have a balcony - but that does not exist in this hotel. Text should be updated.
The boat on the lake service had been cancelled."
