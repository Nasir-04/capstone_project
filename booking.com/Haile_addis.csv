8,Good experience but for the cost of staying there I’d rather go to another property,"Amazing location, cleanliness, staff, sauna and steam rooms, pool. Rooms were great, view is great from rooms. Staff were outstanding. Food taste could’ve been better. Tasted bland and for the price the property charges you’d expect the meal to be exceptional but it fell short. My significant other had a terrible experience at the spa for a message session booked with their spa team. We explained our experience to them and the attempted to recover with a free supper experience but as mentioned above the meal just falls short every time. It really bothers me to write this cause the staff is so kind and tentative so I have to give them the credit for trying.",

From the moment I arrived, I was impressed by the excellent service provided by the staff. Not only were they professional and attentive, but they also seemed genuinely happy to be working there, which created a warm and welcoming atmosphere throughout my stay. One aspect that particularly stood out to me was the cleanliness of the hotel. The rooms were immaculate, and the common areas were always well-maintained. It's evident that the hotel takes great pride in ensuring a high standard of cleanliness for its guests. Furthermore, I was impressed by the availability and willingness of the staff to assist with any requests or inquiries. Whether it was the shuttle driver who ensured smooth transportation, the room service staff who provided prompt and delicious meals, the receptionist who was always helpful and accommodating, or the cleaners who kept the rooms spotless, everyone went above and beyond to ensure a comfortable and enjoyable stay. The Haile Grand Addis Hotel truly provides international tourism standards that rival many other places I've stayed in Addis Ababa. It's evident that they prioritize the satisfaction of their guests, and it shows in every aspect of their service. Overall, my experience at Haile Grand Addis Hotel was exceptional, and I would not hesitate to return or recommend it to others.
