10,Where 5+ star hotel experience exists,"Haile Resort Hawassa is a great choice for anyone who values cleanliness, friendliness, and professional service. The resort is very well-maintained, with spotless rooms and facilities. The staff are courteous, attentive, and efficient, making sure that every guest feels welcome and satisfied. The service is excellent, from the check-in to the check-out, and everything in between. The resort also has a lot of amenities, such as a pool, a spa, a gym, and a restaurant. The location is ideal, as it is close to the lake and the city center. I had a fantastic time at Haile Resort Hawassa and I would definitely stay there again. It is a gem of a place in Ethiopia."

9,A great stay for some relaxing days,"I had a great stay for 2 nights at the Resort and would have loved to stay a bit longer.
My room had a great view to the lake. The area of the hotel is beautiful and I could see a lot of different birds and also a hippo mum with her small baby. The staff is really friendly and helpful. The restaurant offers good meals and there is a good spa. I also loved the area outside below the big tree for having a snack and a drink.
The Wifi was on the room quite weak."

10,Exceptional,I’m really happy staying Haile Resort all stuffs great coustemr service I wish staying longer I’m really happy for every. It’s great and clean.
10,Exceptional,"The pool, spa, gym, seating areas, views, staff, and the rooms were absolutely fantastic
Mekdes M and Wedeye were great servers and help!
The curtain in 2233 is a bit broken, but we made it work. The water bottles were very expensive for staying a few days. It would be very nice if those staying at the hotel could have a discount at the restaurants.
Also- it would be very nice if the pools had sitting areas in the pool! It gets very hot and it’s nice to sit in shallow water
Also- it’d be nice to have plants or something on the first floor roof. The views are so nice but the dirty roofs were a bit off putting"
10,Great Hospitality.,"Other Ethiopian hotels should learn from them.Try to make the swimming pool warm. All the facilities were best and keep it up. And it is also best for family vacation.
Cold swimming pool."
3,Good location but poor service!,"The location was amazing. Specifically, the wine bar was great.
They didn’t have towels in the bathroom. We literally had to beg them for it. When i called the reception downstairs, they actually asked whether we have taken it or misplaced the towels. I had to go down to the reception 4 times to ask for towels and bathrobe again and again. They kept saying they’ll send it right away every time which was so frustrating. They finally brought it to our room almost 6hrs later which was very frustrating."
10,Exceptional,The staff was very friendly and the lakeview was amazing. The food in the Restaurant was really good.
10,Exceptional,"We enjoyed our stay in Haile Resort in Hawassa very much. The views over the lake where so nice at sunset. We enjoyed the birdlife. The boat trip from the hotel was very nice, we saw hippo's. The food is great and staff is super friendly. Really recommand this hotel
