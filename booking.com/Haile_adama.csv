8,"The location is great and it is conducive for business, rest and pleasure.","The breakfast was good but some of the foods were cold. The location is fantastic and conducive for work and rest.
There was no secured internet, so I could not use it. Hopefully, efforts would be made to install secured internet since the place is far away from the city."

Food not that tastefull for European customers."
10,Exhilarating,"Breakfast was yummy and generous. Rooms r super clean and organized. Very classy! The pool is very nice as well as the sauna bath.
Just work on your macchiato/cappuccino from the breakfast menu. Also fix your steam bath as soon as possible."

No water in the morning. Untrained staff"
6,Pleasant,"The room, the staff, The spa.
The food. Vegeterian(fasting food) very chilly (hot) better if milder with a lot more variety."
2,It was a nice business meeting with helpful locals. The town is unattractive.,"The venue was chosen by the organizers of our stay, so it should be among the best available, and we should not pay.
Food was of course local, sufficiently mild for western visitors; I could manage reasonable breakfast (fruit juices just squeezed, only one type per day, if you are lucky you get fantastic pineapple with pulp inside!). Buffet lunch was manageable (I had plain rice and ingera, that makes good to work in the afterlunch). I should have been more careful on what to choose for dinner (once I made a spicy mistake, my misunderstanding and fault!) A VERY nice three-layer fruit spritz (just the word, don't know what Italian spritz is) with avocado, mango and whatever was the other green on top! Local coffee is among the best, if the lady does not overcook.
The room bathroom is awful: the shower sprayed COLD water all around (another colleague had piping hot water, which is also no good). I could not understand from the maids when they would do my room (I don't mind, I make up my bed also at home). There were problems with electronic payment (I was lucky). There are different wireless in the different areas, and in the most important one, the meeting venue, there was no internet. Also the mike was unreliable."
