9,Extraordinary stay and comfort.,Diverse and really nutritional
10,Wonderful,"Exceptional staff at the front desk, business office, housekeeping, and particularly the dining rooms. Beds were comfortable."
9,Very good,"The staff was exceptionally knowledgeable and very welcoming. They went out of their way to ensure that we were taken care of. The ambience of the resort is quite breathtaking. The breakfast buffet was quite nice, but could have offered more English menu items. I would definitely recommend it for anyone visiting Arba Minche.
The only negative part of the stay was the WIFI. The wifi was absolutely horrible. It worked off and on during the day throughout the resort, and it never worked in the room. We had to use phone data or a portable myfi when in the room."
8,fine stay with gorgeous views of two lakes,"beautiful views, friendly and helpful staff`"
9,Superb,"When we arrived, we were told that the booking they recieved didnt include lake view, however my booking disagreed.
The staff were very customer friendly, and the next day when the lake view room was available, they switched us. The rooms had a great standard. Best placed Ive stayed in Ethiopia. The pool was great and clean.
There weren't any evening activites, like live music."
9,Highly recommend! Worth a visit.,"Fantastic views and wonderful service.
The staff were friendly, polite, and attentive but English was very limited so some things were difficult to communicate."
10,Exceptional hotel in beautiful location,"There is so much to like about this hotel. The setting, looking out to the forests, lakes and mountains is stunning. The service is first class with every member of staff eager to please. Mr Getasew was particularly impressive and ensured that our stay was as enjoyable as possible. There is a nice choice at breakfast. The rooms are comfortable and spotlessly clean. I would stress the importance of booking a lake view room as this is very much part of the experience with this hotel. Watching the sunrise from the balcony was a real highlight. I cannot recommend this hotel enough and would say that it is the must stay place in Arba Minch. For anyone interested in touring it is the perfect stay for a short break. Those people wishing for relaxation in a beautiful location could enjoy longer with the leisure facilities. A quality hotel in an area in which top accommodation is hard to find.
The communication via 'messages' on Booking.com was not up to the usual standard and needs tweaking."
9,An excellent experience! Would recommend for anyone but smokers :D,"Almost everything.
There was only one place for smoking and paying for things was always a bit slow."
8,Very good,"I really satisfied and enjoy thanks haile resorts
