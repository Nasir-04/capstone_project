8,A pleasant experience,"It was an excellent hotel and the staff couldn’t do enough for me
There was no shuttle to pick me up. I had to make my own way there. They seemed reluctant to pick me up when I called"
8,Really was a new feeling,"The view, stuff. All facilities
The foods not so much"
8,My stay was comfortable.,"The breakfast was good and staff very courteous.
The room need exterminator for bugs in bathroom. The resort needs renovation repair work."
8,Very good,"What I like is the view in front of the hotel.
Some times no water some times no light"
7,"Probably the best choice in the town, but with its own issues","The service is really excellent - the staff is trained to greet&smile to the guests and that creates a really good ambience. One non-apparent advantage of the hotel - they have their own electricity generators, which helps a lot when there are power shortages in the city (that is quite common). The view from the windows is hard to beat (if your room is facing the city, of course - this needs to be double-checked). In general, there are many official UN and alike delegations hosted in the hotel, so this might also be a sign of relative quality.
The general cleanliness of the room is below average, especially with regard to the bed sheets. My laundry was simply left unattended in the room (because ""there were some problems with the drying machine""), the phone in the room was not functioning at all (and there is no elevator to go down and up from the reception - a considerable drawback given the city's altitude of 2,500m)."
8,Very good,"Best breakfast in Ethiopia I found to western standards.
Leaking bathtub in the room"
1,Worst experience in Ethiopia. Don’t ever stay there!,"Booked this hotel, because they advertise their swimming pool. The problem is that it’s under constant cleaning/ maintenance and not available to use, even though the staff promise it would be available the following day. Room: cold shower, water doesn’t go down. Restaurant: you never get all toppings on your pizza.
Summery: asked them to discount my bill due to all inconveniences, they refused."
5,"May be the best hotel in Gondar, just consider standards are different from other places",WiFi was often saturated and wouldn't allow a connection. Breakfast looked stale. Shower drain was clogged. Bathroom didn't flush properly. Bed linen felt cheap.
10,I am very happy,Good customer service
9,Superb,Was very happy with the quality of the accommodation and the airport pickup
9,Superb,"Good location to the main sites. Nice friendly staff, Appreciated the airport shuttle, Pleasant room"
10,Amazing,"Amazing hotel and great location in Gondar! The rooms were clean with strong WiFi, hot water, and there is also a nice pool. The breakfast buffet was huge and dinner in the restaurant was delicious. The reception staff were absolutely fantastic - they organised tours for me to the castles in Gondar, hiking in the Simien Mountains, and even a very early bus to My Tsebri. I highly recommend Haile Resort!"
4,Disappointing,"The hotel is situated in a good location. The check in process was smooth.
There was a foul smell coming from the bathrooms. The space looks well overdue for some renovations (cracks on walls, damaged doors etc. The checkout experience was horrible due to their inefficient system"
1,Do not go to haile gondar!!!!,The hotel facilities are very bad it doesn't fit the name or brand !!!!
4,Disappointing,"Really tasty food and coffee (really nicely decorated room for traditional coffee) and friendly staff.
We think this place is highly overrated. It is presented to be one of the best in country and recommended , but it was rather disappointing. Not sure about other Haile resorts in other parts of the country , but this one is not so good. For the price it could have been better , there is some maintenance needed in the room, water kettle to make tea in room is missing (which we had in other much cheaper hotels). There are some dents in wall and cables sticking out and lights in room were flickering , table lamp not working at all.
We had very unpleasant experience, hotel staff / cleaning lady came to knock at the door and when my partner opened she could not explain in English why she came and she just walked in the room (while me laying in bed half-naked, half-sleeping ) and turned on the lights - hit all the switches in room and left without word…
We had no words , and are still quite shocked by this.
This should NEVER happen!!!
Please make sure it won’t!!!
Also be aware that swimming pool of the resort is apparently also open for public, not only guests , and it was very crowded. Moreover, beds by the pool were also half-broken and not comfortable (again maintenance needed).

Too many things were just wrong here, so unfortunately we need to give low score for this place and cant recommend it as a place to stay in Gonder."
