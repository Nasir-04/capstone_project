5,Exceptional,"Loved this place! Staff are so friendly and professional. Room was gorgeous. Grounds are lovely. Pool area and wellness Center were clean and well organised. The only disappointment was my dinner. I sat in the bar area and my food came and it was cold and I didnÂt like it. I am not a picky eater and have eaten lots of great Ethiopian food. The sandwich had a sauce on it that tasted terrible. They wanted to replace it but I was not longer hungry. They offered me a plate of fruit which was very nice. BUT, when the bill came, they had charged me for the meal! I tried to discuss it with the server and he refused to even take 1/2 the amount. DonÂt let this discourage you from enjoying this place. I just had a bit of bad luck!",Positive

The hotel has not had internet for 6 days, elevators was not working for 2 days, the TV in the room doesn't work, the phones in the room doesn't work, the treadmill in their gym doesn't work. As this trip was work trip, it was impossible to get some work done. The hotel staff kept promising how internet issues will be fixed by 8 AM, then by 12..
When I asked to cancel my reservation for the remaining days that I had left, they refused to reimburse me. I had make a new booking at another hotel. I still have not been reimbursed even though the manager promised I would get my money as soon as they receive email, booking.com has sent several emails and no response from Haile Grand.",Negative

1,It was a nice business meeting with helpful locals. The town is unattractive.,"The venue was chosen by the organizers of our stay, so it should be among the best available, and we should not pay.
Food was of course local, sufficiently mild for western visitors; I could manage reasonable breakfast (fruit juices just squeezed, only one type per day, if you are lucky you get fantastic pineapple with pulp inside!). Buffet lunch was manageable (I had plain rice and ingera, that makes good to work in the afterlunch). I should have been more careful on what to choose for dinner (once I made a spicy mistake, my misunderstanding and fault!) A VERY nice three-layer fruit spritz (just the word, don't know what Italian spritz is) with avocado, mango and whatever was the other green on top! Local coffee is among the best, if the lady does not overcook.
The room bathroom is awful: the shower sprayed COLD water all around (another colleague had piping hot water, which is also no good). I could not understand from the maids when they would do my room (I don't mind, I make up my bed also at home). There were problems with electronic payment (I was lucky). There are different wireless in the different areas, and in the most important one, the meeting venue, there was no internet. Also the mike was unreliable.",Negative

The breakfast buffet was quite nice, but could have offered more English menu items. I would definitely recommend it for anyone visiting Arba Minche.
The only negative part of the stay was the WIFI. The wifi was absolutely horrible. It worked off and on during the day throughout the resort, and it never worked in the room. We had to use phone data or a portable myfi when in the room.",Positive

There weren't any evening activites, like live music.",Positive
4.5,Highly recommend! Worth a visit.,"Fantastic views and wonderful service.
The staff were friendly, polite, and attentive but English was very limited so some things were difficult to communicate.",Positive
5,Exceptional hotel in beautiful location,"There is so much to like about this hotel. The setting, looking out to the forests, lakes and mountains is stunning. The service is first class with every member of staff eager to please. Mr Getasew was particularly impressive and ensured that our stay was as enjoyable as possible. There is a nice choice at breakfast. The rooms are comfortable and spotlessly clean. I would stress the importance of booking a lake view room as this is very much part of the experience with this hotel. Watching the sunrise from the balcony was a real highlight. I cannot recommend this hotel enough and would say that it is the must stay place in Arba Minch. For anyone interested in touring it is the perfect stay for a short break. Those people wishing for relaxation in a beautiful location could enjoy longer with the leisure facilities. A quality hotel in an area in which top accommodation is hard to find.
The communication via 'messages' on Booking.com was not up to the usual standard and needs tweaking.",Positive

The two extremely comfortable adjoining rooms connected to a living area in the middle . It was worth it to pay the extra to wake up to the sunrise over the lake with the mountains. Absolutely gorgeous views. The air conditioning was a great asset, and the shower pressure was comfortably strong. The included morning buffet was great, but the a la carte menu took an hour to prepare every time, and it cost 2000ETB each time to feed five of us. While it was convenient to eat at the hotel sometimes, the food was better and cheaper at Paradise Lodge and the Tourisy Hotel.",Positive

Clean environment with breathtaking scenery from a cliff.The food tastes great. I highly recommend the lake side rooms for the best terrace view. You cant run out of activities out there but I wish the hotel extends its guest complementary facilities as a courtesy until shuttle pickup time rather than checkout time which is 11am for a 1:30pm afternoon airport shuttle service.

Couple of things i didn't like- i had to book two rooms for family of 5 and i was charged for addtion bed they broght for a kid. This is a bit strange based on experinces in North American where hotles try their best to accomodate their guests. Another strange thing was at the check out you have to wait till someone is sent to check the room. I don't know if that is necessay specially if they have your credit card info. In my opnion, they are expected to trust their guest.",Positive

They should close the doors at night to limit mosquitoes in the hotel lobby.",Positive
4,Very good,"The location on the hill overlooking the lake is good, and the staff and food are also good. However, the front desk does not provide any tourist information such as access to nearby World Heritage sites, so you have to look it up yourself. Since the hotel is in such a good location, it would be nice to have a tour desk. Guests with ample time and budget seem to rent 4WDs and go out on their own. No one staying at this hotel seems to go to the world-famous Konso in a poor local minibus.",Positive

4,International style accommodation in Gondar,"The hotel is very clean and the staff are very helpful. The pool looks good however we did not use it.

5,Exceptional,Excellent views over Gondar and the surrounding mountains. Staff is very attenetive and friendly. Rooms are clean and nicely appointed.,Positive
5,Great option at the more luxurious end in Gondar,"This is a (relatively) more expensive but very good option in Gondar. It's conveniently placed, in a beautiful setting, and benefits from a slick and comfortable restaurant on the premises. The outside terrace is great for an evening drink while watching the sun set over Gondar. If you're planning to hike the Simiens and you book the return night at the resort, then they will store your luggage for free. We were also upgraded to a Junior Suite without any particular reason we could ascertain. Water pressure is not great in the showers but I think that's more to do with Gondar than the hotel. The staff were great - warm, friendly and engaged. If you're a bit tired of roughing it this makes for a very nice change of pace at (by western standards) an affordable price.",Positive

4,Comfortable stay,"We stayed here before and after our Simien Mountains bike. Service is great and they include complimentary airport pick up and drop off. Both rooms we stayed in were comfortable and had everything we needed. They are dark though when the sun goes down. Lighting is not very good. WiFi is terrible in the rooms though, you can only get it when youre standing right up against the door. Better to just go outside to the lobby to use it which can be inconvenient at times. I would stay there again if I went back to Gondar",Positive

2,Fair,"Bad check in experience - no towels provided and had to ask 4 times over the course of 5 hours before we got them. Bedsheets were also very damp and weren't changed until hours after we asked. Bathroom ventilation system was awful, could smell toilets and cigarette smoke from neighbouring room. Room walls paper thin, sandwiched between a noisy family and a guy who had his TV on full blast past 11pm until we reported it to reception. Lack of ventilation in the room, became incredibly hot in the morning. No kettle in room, no lift/elevator on the property either. Phone didn't work and no contact number sheet provided for calling reception quickly. Lack of conveniently placed power sockets in room. Free airport transfer was helpful however, WiFi decent and the breakfast was not bad.",Negative

3.5,"Probably the best choice in the town, but with its own issues","The service is really excellent - the staff is trained to greet&smile to the guests and that creates a really good ambience. One non-apparent advantage of the hotel - they have their own electricity generators, which helps a lot when there are power shortages in the city (that is quite common). The view from the windows is hard to beat (if your room is facing the city, of course - this needs to be double-checked). In general, there are many official UN and alike delegations hosted in the hotel, so this might also be a sign of relative quality.
The general cleanliness of the room is below average, especially with regard to the bed sheets. My laundry was simply left unattended in the room (because ""there were some problems with the drying machine""), the phone in the room was not functioning at all (and there is no elevator to go down and up from the reception - a considerable drawback given the city's altitude of 2,500m).",Positive
4,Very good,"Best breakfast in Ethiopia I found to western standards.
Leaking bathtub in the room",Positive
0.5,Worst experience in Ethiopia. Dont ever stay there!,"Booked this hotel, because they advertise their swimming pool. The problem is that its under constant cleaning/ maintenance and not available to use, even though the staff promise it would be available the following day. Room: cold shower, water doesnt go down. Restaurant: you never get all toppings on your pizza.
Summery: asked them to discount my bill due to all inconveniences, they refused.",Negative

5,Amazing,"Amazing hotel and great location in Gondar! The rooms were clean with strong WiFi, hot water, and there is also a nice pool. The breakfast buffet was huge and dinner in the restaurant was delicious. The reception staff were absolutely fantastic - they organised tours for me to the castles in Gondar, hiking in the Simien Mountains, and even a very early bus to My Tsebri. I highly recommend Haile Resort!",Positive
2,Disappointing,"The hotel is situated in a good location. The check in process was smooth.
There was a foul smell coming from the bathrooms. The space looks well overdue for some renovations (cracks on walls, damaged doors etc. The checkout experience was horrible due to their inefficient system",Negative
0.5,Do not go to haile gondar!!!!,The hotel facilities are very bad it doesn't fit the name or brand !!!!,Negative
2,Disappointing,"Really tasty food and coffee (really nicely decorated room for traditional coffee) and friendly staff.
We think this place is highly overrated. It is presented to be one of the best in country and recommended , but it was rather disappointing. Not sure about other Haile resorts in other parts of the country , but this one is not so good. For the price it could have been better , there is some maintenance needed in the room, water kettle to make tea in room is missing (which we had in other much cheaper hotels). There are some dents in wall and cables sticking out and lights in room were flickering , table lamp not working at all.
We had very unpleasant experience, hotel staff / cleaning lady came to knock at the door and when my partner opened she could not explain in English why she came and she just walked in the room (while me laying in bed half-naked, half-sleeping ) and turned on the lights - hit all the switches in room and left without word
We had no words , and are still quite shocked by this.
This should NEVER happen!!!
Please make sure it wont!!!
Also be aware that swimming pool of the resort is apparently also open for public, not only guests , and it was very crowded. Moreover, beds by the pool were also half-broken and not comfortable (again maintenance needed).

Too many things were just wrong here, so unfortunately we need to give low score for this place and cant recommend it as a place to stay in Gonder.",Negative

The hotel is spotlessly clean, the toilets are constantly cleaned. The location on the lake is fantastic, see photo. The only negative point was that the restaurant, like many other restaurants in Ethiopia, uses glutamate for cooking. If you don't have a problem with that, then we can recommend the Haile Resort without reservation.",Positive

Also- it would be very nice if the pools had sitting areas in the pool! It gets very hot and its nice to sit in shallow water
Also- itd be nice to have plants or something on the first floor roof. The views are so nice but the dirty roofs were a bit off putting",Positive

They didnt have towels in the bathroom. We literally had to beg them for it. When i called the reception downstairs, they actually asked whether we have taken it or misplaced the towels.

Always in for a chat and a smile was always given. The place allows for some strolling outside to the lakeside, enjoy a drink on the terras and the food is taste. Internet is stable and available on the compound. In for coffee? Ask for the local ""buna"" or coffee and you will be teated with a delight.",Positive
4,Very good,"Very nice and welcoming staff in all areas. Good food. There is a nice looking pool, but I never used it. Fair internet connection for Ethiopia. Price - value is correct. The garden is very nice. You can observe monheys and many types of birds. There is access to the lake shore walk way, which is quite nice. They offer nice boat tours in the lake. This time I was not able to do, but I will probably next time. For sure I will come back. Beds are very good. Also, all found clean, however there are always coming in some ants from the gardens, what may be uncomfortable for some people. There is given free bottled drinking water every day. Housekeeping is done nicely every day. The only thing they may improve. Rusty water come out on hand wash and shower, it smells metallic rusty and has a yellow colour, probably rusted tank. Also, it would be nice to get in every room a good mosquito net installed fix as standard. Now you have to ask for it. I would suggest to sacrify one of the guest rooms in the garden to install the massage room there, just to be able to have a nicer place for this. It's definitely the best hotel option in Ziway. I will come back again.",Positive

Staff is really assistant and informative plus friendly. Bell boy offered to change my normal room to the room with lake view at no extra charge. Traditional Coffee shop is next to the lobby and you pay for only 10 birr. Overall, I do love the place. It's a really nice resort I've ever stayed at affordable price.

Breakfast was great - fresh eggs / omelette made to order, great coffee. T The resort is full of birds - fish eagles and little yellow and blue birds and we loved how lush and well kept the property gardens were.
the pool was clean and well presented but there were only 4 lounge chairs - wooden, no mattresses and slightly broken. This is an area that could be addressed. We were given pool towels which was great.

The bungalows are small and the fan in our room sounded like an airplane taking off so we couldn't use it. It would be great if there was a mosquito mesh on the window so we could sleep with the window open.",Positive
