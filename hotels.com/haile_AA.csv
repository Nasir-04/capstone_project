10,Exceptional,"The property is brand new, only a few months old. That being said, the property is clean, organized, and inviting. Every single staff member is amazingly friendly, gracious, and ready to assist in any way they can! The swimming pool is beautiful, and a high standard of cleanliness is maintained. It was difficult to believe that you are in such a densely populated city."
10,Exceptional,"Loved this place! Staff are so friendly and professional. Room was gorgeous. Grounds are lovely. Pool area and wellness Center were clean and well organised. The only disappointment was my dinner. I sat in the bar area and my food came and it was cold and I didn’t like it. I am not a picky eater and have eaten lots of great Ethiopian food. The sandwich had a sauce on it that tasted terrible. They wanted to replace it but I was not longer hungry. They offered me a plate of fruit which was very nice. BUT, when the bill came, they had charged me for the meal! I tried to discuss it with the server and he refused to even take 1/2 the amount. Don’t let this discourage you from enjoying this place. I just had a bit of bad luck!"
