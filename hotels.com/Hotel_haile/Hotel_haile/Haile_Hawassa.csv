10,dream by the lake,"The staff were extremely friendly and polite. This started at the door with security and continued all the way to the free shuttle to the airport. The hotel is spotlessly clean, the toilets are constantly cleaned. The location on the lake is fantastic, see photo. The only negative point was that the restaurant, like many other restaurants in Ethiopia, uses glutamate for cooking. If you don't have a problem with that, then we can recommend the Haile Resort without reservation."
10,Exceptional,"Excellent resort, beautiful location, friendly staff!"
10,Comfortable stay and helpful staff,"Great resort, very good service, beautiful lake-side view and relaxed atmosphere."
10,Exceptional,"Excellent Hotel. Friendly and very accommodating staff. Excellent food and selection of choices at breakfast. Beautiful setting. The view of Lake Awassa from our floor was stunning--changed every time we looked out the window. There was a problem with our initial room request, but they quickly fixed things for us."

8,Lectures at MSc. course Wonod Genet,"Very good but the shower needed to be turn on in 30 minutes every morgning in order to get hot water ( 2nd floor, sea view), and the internet connection was extremely unstable. Stable internet connection was one of the main reason the hotel was chosen because I needed to do som home work in the afternoons."
