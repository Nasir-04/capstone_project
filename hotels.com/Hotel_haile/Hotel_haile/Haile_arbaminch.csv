10,Wonderful visit—Loved Our Stay,"We rented a premium suite for our family of five, and added a comfortable cot for $29 a day. The two extremely comfortable adjoining rooms connected to a living area in the middle . It was worth it to pay the extra to wake up to the sunrise over the lake with the mountains. Absolutely gorgeous views. The air conditioning was a great asset, and the shower pressure was comfortably strong. The included morning buffet was great, but the a la carte menu took an hour to prepare every time, and it cost 2000ETB each time to feed five of us. While it was convenient to eat at the hotel sometimes, the food was better and cheaper at Paradise Lodge and the Tourisy Hotel."

10,Exceptional,We stay here frequently because we can count on excellent service and everything being in working order. It is stress free. The staff are wonderful and we like the food very much.
10,Amazing staff with stunning scenery??,We had a short but amazing stay at Haile’s Arbaminch. Very helpful staff with amazing smiles. Clean environment with breathtaking scenery from a cliff.The food tastes great. I highly recommend the lake side rooms for the best terrace view. You can’t run out of activities out there but I wish the hotel extends its guest complementary facilities as a courtesy until shuttle pickup time rather than checkout time which is 11am for a 1:30pm afternoon airport shuttle service. We are deeply satisfied; and proud to recommend this hotel.

10,Exceptional,"I am mesmerised by this perfect Hotel with heavenly kind of customer service. the only thing I can say is God bless the whole staff at Haile Resort, keep up the nice service."
6,Good,"The spa is really good and the people working in the spa department did a really good job. In generally all employees working in this property treat their customers really good. BUT they were out of some room aminities like shampoo, rooth paste, shower cup and some more. We are paying a lot but doesnt even get the basic aminities. Additionally the food in most of the haile resorts doesnt taste really good but it ua over priced. He need to work on that on most of his resturants."
10,Exceptional,Great staff. This hotel is the best and most respectful by far. They accommodate all needs for customers. I love them!

10,Exceptional,"Haile Resort ,It was excellent in every sense!"
8,Very good,"I like the cleanness of the rooms and the restaurants. The serviceis excellent. The royal level reception starts right at the gate and follows you all the way untill you leave the resort. Steam, sauna and spa are complimentary. Massage is also at very reasonable price. Couple of things i didn't like- i had to book two rooms for family of 5 and i was charged for addtion bed they broght for a kid. This is a bit strange based on experinces in North American where hotles try their best to accomodate their guests. Another strange thing was at the check out you have to wait till someone is sent to check the room. I don't know if that is necessay specially if they have your credit card info. In my opnion, they are expected to trust their guest."

8,Very good,Very nice and relaxing
8,Very good,"we have been here multiple times over the last few years. It continues to be always clean and neat. The food is improving nicely. Service is many times slow, even now when few people are here in the hotel because of Covid 19. Service staff are very friendly and nice. the gym is cleaner than before and the machines are working. They should close the doors at night to limit mosquitoes in the hotel lobby."
,Very good,"The location on the hill overlooking the lake is good, and the staff and food are also good. However, the front desk does not provide any tourist information such as access to nearby World Heritage sites, so you have to look it up yourself. Since the hotel is in such a good location, it would be nice to have a tour desk. Guests with ample time and budget seem to rent 4WDs and go out on their own. No one staying at this hotel seems to go to the world-famous Konso in a poor local minibus."
8,Very good,"The scenery from the escarpment down to the jungle, 2 lakes and hills in the background is great!"
10,Our best hotel experience in Ethiopia,"Our best hotel experience in Ethiopia. The place is nice with a beautiful view of the 2 lakes. The establishment is recent, well equipped and comfortable. The restaurant is very good too and the staff attentive."
6,Good,Very clean and sharp. Great views. Great help staff
