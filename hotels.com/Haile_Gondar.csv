8,Very good,"One of the best hotel in Gondar. Staff don’t speak much English, it’s a popular event place for locals. So you need to expect some noises"

10,Very good hotel but expensive,"Very good hotel for Ethiopian standards. Very friendly, helpful staff. Very clean, large rooms. Decent TV. Bathroom needs to be renovated but hot shower. WiFi works because router is installed in front of the room. Fridge hardly cools. Kettle in the room. Breakfast is plentiful for Ethiopia and also includes western dishes and egg dishes. Fruit, bread. Unfortunately price too high."

6,Good,"The hotel is in pretty worn conditions, quite hot at night, average restaurant. The nice thing is the pool, but please note that it's not restricted to hotel guests, so when we arrived on a Sunday, it was completely full with day users. So, in summary, the hotel is pretty average and the pool is nice."
8,International style accommodation in Gondar,"The hotel is very clean and the staff are very helpful. The pool looks good however we did not use it. Breakfast had many choices and including western dishes. Compared to Ethiopia the bed was comfortable and the towels were great. Specifically we could not close the bathroom door and our shower was not comfortable to operate. We had no working wifi in the room, unless we stood by the door."
10,Exceptional,Excellent views over Gondar and the surrounding mountains. Staff is very attenetive and friendly. Rooms are clean and nicely appointed.
10,Great option at the more luxurious end in Gondar,"This is a (relatively) more expensive but very good option in Gondar. It's conveniently placed, in a beautiful setting, and benefits from a slick and comfortable restaurant on the premises. The outside terrace is great for an evening drink while watching the sun set over Gondar. If you're planning to hike the Simiens and you book the return night at the resort, then they will store your luggage for free. We were also upgraded to a Junior Suite without any particular reason we could ascertain. Water pressure is not great in the showers but I think that's more to do with Gondar than the hotel. The staff were great - warm, friendly and engaged. If you're a bit tired of roughing it this makes for a very nice change of pace at (by western standards) an affordable price."

8,Comfortable stay,"We stayed here before and after our Simien Mountains bike. Service is great and they include complimentary airport pick up and drop off. Both rooms we stayed in were comfortable and had everything we needed. They are dark though when the sun goes down. Lighting is not very good. WiFi is terrible in the rooms though, you can only get it when you’re standing right up against the door. Better to just go outside to the lobby to use it which can be inconvenient at times. I would stay there again if I went back to Gondar"
10,Highly recommended without a doubt.,"The detail of the fruit tray upon arrival, very comfortable room with fridge and kettle and an excellent breakfast. The views from the room are great. Highly recommended. The staff is very attentive."

4,Fair,"Bad check in experience - no towels provided and had to ask 4 times over the course of 5 hours before we got them. Bedsheets were also very damp and weren't changed until hours after we asked. Bathroom ventilation system was awful, could smell toilets and cigarette smoke from neighbouring room. Room walls paper thin, sandwiched between a noisy family and a guy who had his TV on full blast past 11pm until we reported it to reception. Lack of ventilation in the room, became incredibly hot in the morning. No kettle in room, no lift/elevator on the property either. Phone didn't work and no contact number sheet provided for calling reception quickly. Lack of conveniently placed power sockets in room. Free airport transfer was helpful however, WiFi decent and the breakfast was not bad."
8,Very good,The view of the Castle is good as is the location quite near the centre of town. The property has a very nice 16m. swimming pool which was functional at least during my visit. The restaurant has a wide choice and was pretty good
8,Very good,"They provided me with an excellent guide. The breakfast was good but the dinner that I had was inedible. Also Ethiopians seated next to me eating traditional Ethiopian food said it was just barely ok. Stay there for the hotel part but don’t eat anything there except breakfast, would be my recommendation"
10,Exceptional,"Very nice hotel. Clean, very well located in town close to everything. Varied breakfast and very attentive staff."

8,Very good,"I like the big room they gave us unfortunately the hot tub in the room didn't worked. Also in the amenities it said dry & wet sauna, gym & pool yet at the moment they only have the pool!! We wanted to enjoy the dry sauna!!!"
8,Very good,A good hotel Spa/sauna had not been working for 3 months but was being advertised when booked
10,Fully recommend,We are there only 2 days but we enjoy this time very much. Hotel Staff was very kind and helpful. Room was very clean and well equiped ( there was even hair conditiiner! :D hairdryer and cold drinks).
8,"Wonderful staff, but a bit maintanance required","Staff was wonderful, as usual in Ethiopia. Wifi signal was too weak in my room, had to connect from the corridor. Lighting in the room insufficient, most sockets didn't work. No mosquito net. Breakfast ok. No elevator (not a big deal for me, but could be an issue for others). Location is very good, quite close to the Four Sisters restaurant and not far away from the castle."
