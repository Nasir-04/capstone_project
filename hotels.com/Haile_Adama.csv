10,Friendly and clean,"The staff are all friendly and the accommodations are clean and comfortable. The hotel is in a well-organized garden, and the food is delicious and suits me personally. The Haile Special Juice is good… However, there are no tissues, so it is inconvenient to remove makeup (use toilet paper)."
